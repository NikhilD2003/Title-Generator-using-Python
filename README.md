# Title-Generator-using-Python
# Description-
This Python project constitutes a rudimentary title generator equipped with a graphical user interface. The application's core functionality revolves around generating potential titles based on user-inputted keywords. It employs a rule-based approach, utilizing a collection of predefined templates to construct title variations. To enrich the generated titles, the code incorporates the NLTK library's WordNet, expanding the keyword base through synonym and related word identification. The generated titles are subsequently displayed within the graphical interface, affording users the liberty to select their preferred option. While functional, the project's title generation capabilities are restricted by its rule-based nature and lack of sophisticated language processing techniques, limiting the diversity and creativity of the output.
